                <p><strong>Customer</strong>: an individual who contacts us
                    about our goods/services, or who has entered into a contract
                    with us.</p>
                <p><strong>Personal data</strong>: data, whether true or not,
                    about a customer who can be identified from that data alone
                    or with other information we are likely to have access to
                    (e.g., name, address, email, phone, nationality, gender,
                    date of birth, marital status, photograph).</p>

                <h2>2. Collection, Use & Disclosure</h2>
                <p>We generally collect personal data only when you (or your
                    authorised representative) have been notified of the
                    purposes and given consent, or where collection/use without
                    consent is permitted or required by law.</p>
                <h3>Purposes</h3>
                <ul class="list">
                    <li>Performing obligations in connection with goods/services
                        requested by you;</li>
                    <li>Responding to and processing queries, requests,
                        applications, complaints and feedback;</li>
                    <li>Complying with applicable laws, regulations, codes,
                        guidelines and assisting law enforcement and
                        investigations;</li>
                    <li>Any other purposes for which you provided the
                        information or that are incidental to the above;</li>
                    <li>Transmitting data to unaffiliated third parties (service
                        providers/agents and relevant authorities, in Singapore
                        or abroad) for these purposes.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Disclosure</h3>
                <p>We may disclose personal data where required to perform our
                    obligations to you, and to third-party service providers and
                    agents engaged by us for the purposes above.</p>
                <p class="muted">These purposes may continue to apply for a
                    reasonable period even after your relationship with us ends
                    (e.g., to enforce contractual rights).</p>

                <h2>3. Deemed Consent by Notification</h2>
                <p>For certain secondary purposes different from the original
                    purpose of collection, we may rely on deemed consent by
                    notification after assessing that doing so is not likely to
                    have an adverse effect on you and after providing an
                    opportunity to opt out within a reasonable period.</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> research on user behaviour.</p>
                <p>You may later withdraw such deemed consent (see Section

                <h2>4. Legitimate Interests Exception</h2>
                <p>Where permitted by the PDPA, we may collect, use or disclose
                    personal data without consent for legitimate interests of
                    Lumeva or another person, after assessing that such
                    interests outweigh any likely adverse effect on you.</p>
                <ul class="list">
                    <li>Fraud detection and prevention;</li>

                    <li>Network analysis to prevent fraud and financial crime,

                        loss.</li>

                    consent (in whole or in part) by writing to our Data
                    Protection Officer (see Section 11). We may need reasonable
                    time to process your request and to explain the
                    consequences, including any impact on our ability to provide
                    goods/services.</p>
                <p class="muted">We aim to process withdrawals within fourteen
                    (14) business days. Withdrawing consent does not affect our

                    disclosed, or (b) correction of your personal data. A
                    reasonable fee may be charged for access; we will inform you
                    of the fee before processing.</p>
                <p class="muted">We generally respond within seven (7) business
                    days, or otherwise notify you within thirty (30) days of
                    when we can respond. If we are unable to provide data or
                    make a correction, we will generally inform you of the
                    reasons unless we are not required to do so under the

                    to safeguard personal data, including minimised collection,
                    access controls and password hygiene, encryption,
